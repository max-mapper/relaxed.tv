Instructional videos about CouchDB!

You can either replicate the couchapp from my couch [http://max.couchone.com/relaxedtv/_design/relaxedtv/index.html](http://max.couchone.com/relaxedtv/_design/relaxedtv/index.html) (quickest option) or, if you want to hack on the source code first, you'll need to install `mikeal/node.couchapp.js` and clone this repo.
